Play button - refresh to new
Hide/show Pig Dice - hit play to show the buttons, show the scoring areas


Objects:

Player 1:
? Rolled value:
Score-person1:

Player 2"
? Rolled value:
Score-person2:

Die 
sides: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Functions: 
  - Random number Function
  - Sum function (adds newest number to score) old number (variable) += new number
    - if output number = 1, set old number variable to 0, end turn
  - Check if score => 100 (if statement?) --> end game
- Trigger HOLD button
- Constructor function - person (sum)

--> triggered by ROLL button

  Variable: 
  - score - starts at 0
  - rolledNumber - added to score

Need to refactor how the data is added in to the Score fields - currently right now, it will only append BECAUSE the "names" are P1 and P2.

optional : Make two sides, grey out one side button when not turn
 ** Ask for player name and display it as player label
